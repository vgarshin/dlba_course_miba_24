# Deep Learning for Business Applications course
## Goals and objectives

Deep Learning (DL) is now a powerful tool but the key factor is also how to apply DL models and techniques to the business processes in order to improve them. In this course, students learn the concept of DL and how DL models are trained and built into business processes. This course will cover the fundamentals of text, image and video processing along with the tools and techniques for DL tasks and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests.

During the course you will learn:
-	What is Deep Learning (DL)
-	What tasks can be solved with DL
-	Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in DL
-	How to apply DL in business tasks
-	Why Neural Networks are the cornerstone of DL
-	What data is processed in DL tasks
-	How to develop DL modelling pipeline and integrate this pipeline into business process
-	How to manage DL modelling pipeline within the organization
-	How to structure DL projects

Overall, after studying this course you should be able to make better business decisions based in the DL approaches.

## Prerequisites 

Development Essentials, Machine Learning and Big Data Analysis, End-to-End Sample ML Project courses.

## Learning outcomes

After the course you will have knowledge and skills of: 
-	solving DL tasks and problems
-	working with tha data for DL models
-	applying DL models in business cases

## Structure and content

1. Introduction to Deep Learning (DL)
    1. Intro to course
    2. How DL differs from Machine Learning (ML). Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs DL vs ML. Terminology (CV, NLP)
    3. History of DL and how DL appeared. Rise of DL in 21st century. Data and computational power as prerequisites for DL modelling
    4. Tasks to solve with DL. Texts analysis (or Natural Language Processing or NLP), Computer Vision (CV) problems, Speac analysis, RL problem, etc.
    5. Reality and myths of DL. What DL can and can not
    6. Business cases and projects based on DL. Translators, speech kits, face and objects recognition, deep fakes etc.
2. Computer Vision (CV) introduction
   1. History of CV. What digital image is (monochrome, color – BGR vs RGB)
   2. Tools for CV that were before NN. OpenCV library: sometimes simple math is enough. Examples for simple object detection
   3. Idea of convolutions. Why convolutions work
   4. Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   5. Image classification task – from simple linear regression approach to CNN (MNIST example)
3. Computer Vision (CV) advanced
   1. Modern CNN’s architecture: deep convolutional layers, pooling and dropout layers, concatenations etc.
   2. Image classification tasks with modern CNNs: evolution over the ImageNet challenge
   3. Work with image classification CNNs: training from scratch vs finetuning and other techniques
   4. What data is needed to train CV model well: quality, volume requirements
   5. Data preprocessing and labeling: tools and solutions
4. Object detection problems. Part 1
   1. Object recognition: classification, detection, segmentation
   2. NNs architectures to tackle this problem: R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN
   3. Data processing and labeling aspects for recognition tasks
